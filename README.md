This is a simple Textutils app, in which you can change the format of the text. You can change text to Upper, Lower, Sentence, title case. The text can also be copied and removed from the textbox. There is light and dark mode for better visibility.

Inspiration & Credits: I built this Textutils app by learning React with [CodewithHarry]. I even added few new features in this... This helped me understand React concepts like state, props, and event handling.
